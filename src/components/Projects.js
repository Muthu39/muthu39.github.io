                <p>Over the years, I’ve dived headfirst into building things—sometimes they worked on the first try (rare), other times I had to fight bugs like a digital gladiator (often). From crafting cybersecurity tools that politely tell hackers “not today,” to full-stack web apps that look good and don’t crash (most of the time), I’ve learned a lot, cried a little, and coded a ton. Below are some of my proudest creations—powered by daily hardwork.</p>
